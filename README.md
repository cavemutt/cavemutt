- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt, aka Jencat & Cavemutt.
- 👀 I'm a perpetual student. I find it challenging to narrow my interests, but life tends to change my chapters from time to time.
- 🌱 I’m currently increasing my skills in web development(HTML, CSS, JS, and popular things related), visual design and editing, animation, photoshop, writing, painting and how to retain hope and compassion in a world that rejects reason, empathy, and being humane.
- 💞️ I will be looking to collaborate on projects in need of front end help using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The ultimate goal is to continue using and learning any and all of the interests and skills listed above, but finishing a nice portfolio needs to come first.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jencatandcavemutt@gmail.com
