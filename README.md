- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt, aka Jencat & Cavemutt.
- 👀 I'm a perpetual student. I thrive when I'm learning more about my interests and my world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently increasing my skills in web development(HTML, CSS, JS, and related), visual design and editing, animation, photoshop, writing, painting and how to retain hope and compassion in a world that stuggles with reason, empathy, and being humane.
- 💞️ I will be looking to collaborate on projects in need of front end help using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The ultimate goal is to have the skills to help people that help others(such as non-profit organizations) and continue learning more about everything I possibly can.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jencatandcavemutt@gmail.com
