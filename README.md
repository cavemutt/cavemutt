- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt, aka Jencat & Cavemutt.
- 👀 I'm a perpetual student. I thrive when I'm learning more about my interests and my world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently increasing my skills in web development(HTML, CSS, JS, and related), visual design and editing, animation, photoshop, writing, painting and how to retain hope and compassion in a world that rejects reason, empathy, and being humane.
- 💞️ I will be looking to collaborate on projects in need of front end help using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The ultimate goal is to continue using and learning any and all of the interests and skills listed above, and maybe more.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jencatandcavemutt@gmail.com
