- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I possibly can, but I can't say that I'm really good at anything in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently increasing my skills in web development, video editing, sound recording, animation, photoshop, writing, acrylic painting and how to survive in a world that rejects reason, empathy, and being humane.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with HTML and CSS needs, and/or front end javascript basic to intermediate help, and I'd love to also use any of the other skills listed above.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jencatandcavemutt@gmail.com
