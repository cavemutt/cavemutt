- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I possibly can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, video editing, sound recording, animation, photoshop, pour painting and how to survive in a world that makes no sense.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate when I get better at the basics.
- 📫 How to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jencatandcavemutt@gmail.com
