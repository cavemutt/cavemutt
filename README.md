- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt, doing dev work under **Jennifer Lee Dev** and some informal creative stuff under Jencat&Cavemutt.
- 👀 I'm a perpetual student. I thrive when I'm learning more about my world, and hopefully, making it better. I have a BA, I am kind but not necessarily 'nice', and I have worn many hats. I've been an artist, musician, piano mover and refinisher, a model, a handy-person, an Airman First Class, a retail Store Manager, an animal rescuer, a social worker, a paperwork filler-outer, a gem and mineral specimen collector, a photo editor, a good listener but not a good person to invite to parties, and now a Software Developer and Web Designer.  
- 🌱 I’m constantly increasing my skills in Software Development(HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node, Next, Java, SQL, Mongo, etc.), visual design, visual editing, animation, photoshop, writing, painting and how to retain hope and compassion in a world that stuggles with reason, empathy, responsibility, and being humane.
- 💞️ As my ultimate goal is to have the skills to help people that help others, and to continue learning more about everything I possibly can, I offer web-based help to non-profit organizations to increase my skills and experience along with contributing to personal and open-source projects in between. 
- 📫 The best way to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jennifer_lee_dev@protonmail.com. Just kidding, it is actually humor.
