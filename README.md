- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavemutt, doing dev work under **Jennifer Lee Dev** and some informal creative stuff under Jencat&Cavemutt.
- 👀 I'm a perpetual student. I thrive when I'm learning more about my world. I have a BA and I have worn many hats, including being an artist and musician to Logistics in the Air Force, to running a retail store, and now a Web Developer and Web Designer. 
- 🌱 I’m constantly increasing my skills in Web development(HTML, CSS, JS, React, getting into backend as well), visual design, visual editing, animation, photoshop, writing, painting and how to retain hope and compassion in a world that stuggles with reason, empathy, and being humane.
- 💞️ As my ultimate goal is to have the skills to help people that help others, and to continue learning more about everything I possibly can, I am offering web-based help to non-profit organizations to increase my skills and experience along with contributing to personal and open-source projects in between.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is with humor. Just kidding. jennifer_lee_dev@protonmail.com
